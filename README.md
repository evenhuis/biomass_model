# biomass_model

This is model for algal growth that includes:
• total biomass: protein, carbohyrate, lipids
• external dissolved carbon
• carbon, N, and P uptake
• gas exhange
• light attenuation

This is primarily used for inference.  Given high frequency dissolved oxygen, pH, biomass, OD, etc what are the rates of carbon fixation.
